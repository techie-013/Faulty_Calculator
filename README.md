# 🔢 Faulty Calculator 🤯

A quirky, beginner-friendly JavaScript project that simulates a *faulty calculator* — one that **deliberately gives wrong results 10% of the time**.  
Perfect for learning `Math.random()`, `eval()`, string interpolation, and conditional logic in JavaScript.

---

## 📌 What It Does

- Takes two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) from the user.
- Calculates the correct result **90% of the time**.
- **Intentionally miscalculates** 10% of the time by swapping the operator using a predefined rule.
- Alerts the user with the (possibly wrong 😜) result.

---

## 💡 Features

- Simple CLI interaction using `prompt()` and `alert()`
- Randomized behavior using `Math.random()`
- Operator manipulation using an object map
- Fun and beginner-friendly logic to explore how conditional errors work

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Variables and user input
- Conditional logic (`if/else`)
- JavaScript objects for operator mapping
- Template literals
- The (infamous) `eval()` function
- Random number generation with `Math.random()`

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `faulty_calculator.html` file in any web browser  
   (or paste the code in a browser console or JS playground like [CodePen](https://codepen.io), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net), or [Replit](https://replit.com))

2. Enter two numbers and an operator when prompted.

3. Check the result — is your calculator lying to you? 😄

## 🎯 Why This Project?

As part of my **daily JavaScript practice**, I built this mini project to:
- Explore randomization and conditionals
- Break the usual seriousness of math tools
- Simulate how logic bugs or errors can be "intentionally" coded
- Make learning fun and interactive!
